## Application Overview
This is the client or frontend side of the [CoffeeBase application](https://github.com/nitekm/CoffeeBaseApi).\
Written in Java in the old style based on Views. \
Currently, this is the production version available for download on Android devices from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ncodedev.coffeebase).\
It uses asynchronous communication with APIs with a couple of interesting solutions in the code.
## Technologies used in the project are:
 * Android SDK
 * Material Design
 * Android Views defined in XML files
 * Retrofit2, OkHttpClient, Interceptors for communication with the backend
 * Java interfaces for handling requests and responses from APIs
 * Picasso for handling images
 * Google Auth Services for authentication
 * Google Billing API for handling purchases

**I encourage you to take a look at the [App's official page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ncodedev.coffeebase) in the Play store!**
